# Here is where I'm stopping with the ALZ-Bicep Deployment.

My objective is to mitigate costs, and I don't think anything else is essential right now. 

For context, I deployed everything in Azure via Powershell and went back and updated this forked repository to match what I implememnted. While unlikely, I acknowledge that there is a small chance that some of the parameter settings in modules 1 - 4.1 differ slightly from what was deployed in Azure.
